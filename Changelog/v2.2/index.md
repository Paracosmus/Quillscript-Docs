# v2.2

![](../../static/img/changelog/2.2.jpg)

We are excited to announce Quillscript latest update, featuring four major new enhancements designed to improve developers' quality of life. Among other things, we introduce the **Variable Modifiers** feature, the **Checkpoint Directive**, and the **Sprite** and **TravelPass** built-in commands.

**Variable Modifiers** let you execute a custom function before a variable value is retrieved, allowing you to modify a variable value or run a required code before the variable is used. **Checkpoint** offers enhanced flow control to stop the Script until a condition is met in Blueprints/C++ code. Additionally, **Sprites** is an experimental new feature that brings a dynamic new layer to our interface with customizable, animated icons that enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

Alongside these significant upgrades, this update also includes various minor enhancements, extra helper functions, and bug fixes to improve overall performance and usability.

**Release Date**: 2024-04-23
**Engine Version**: 5.4
