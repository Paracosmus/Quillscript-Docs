Even in purely narrated games, the narrator has to say something or expose events and ideas to the player.","A Dialogue statement is composed of two or more lines.","The first line starts with - (dash), immediately followed by a whitespace. The dialog metadata represents information like the speaker’s name and conditions.","The subsequent lines are the dialogue itself, the sentence being said.","As a best practice, we use a .

Router statements can use these labels as any other label statement.","It's important to notice that statements can be jumped if they belong to a label statement with a false condition or when they are within a condition statement that is also false. When a router statement points to a label instruction, the flow goes to that point, ignoring any parenting condition and evaluating only the target statement condition, if any."]},{"l":"Display Name","p":["When naming labels, it's common to emerge project patterns that are often non-friendly, containing dots, slashes, prefixes, postfixes, and other marks.","If your project shows labels' names to users for some reason, like in a story tracker, these names are not ideal to be displayed to other developers or players.","You can type a free text line below your label declaration to add a user-friendly name.","Differently from the label declaration itself, which must be a static name, a display name can use variables, replacements, rich text tags, and be formatted or modified by custom code."]}],[{"l":"Covert","p":["A covert label has the same behavior as a standard label, except that a covert label won't play unless explicitly called by a Router. This means if the script flow ever reaches a covert label, it jumps to the following standard label.","A Covert Label starts with <@> (Less Than, At Sign, and Greater Than), immediately followed by a whitespace.","In the example above, the @Where and @Eat labels only play if selected, and the story proceeds to @Continue jumping any covert labels on its flow."]},{"l":"Covert Label as Instruction","p":["If a covert label is used as an instruction in other types of statements, that statement is also jumped unless it is called directly by a router."]}],[{"l":"Template","p":["Templates are a specific type of covert labels that receive entry arguments. A variable is created for each argument and exists until a new label statement is played.","This can reduce repetitive lines and play specific sections of a story that need entry parameters.","Since templates are also covert labels, they can be declared using either @ or <@>","After naming the label, enumerate a list of arguments between parentheses, and separate by commas","Template argument variables start with @","On the router statement, pass the values for each argument in the same order."]},{"l":"Template as Instruction","p":["A label instruction can also be a template. In this case, the statement only plays if directly called by a router, since it becomes a covert statement.","Template variables are created for this statement play and deleted on the following statement play."]}],[{"l":"Router","p":["Routers are navigation controllers to move from one point of the story to a given label, by name. Its main functionality is control where the story should move to, based on player choices, variable values, and custom code.","A Router statement starts with a -> (Dash and Greater Than), immediately followed by a space."]},{"l":"Router as Instruction","p":["A Router can also be concatenated to other statements and used as an instruction.","In Dialogue, Label, Command, and Other Router statements, a router instruction is executed only if the statement conditions fail.","In Option statements, a router instruction is executed when that option is selected."]}],[{"l":"Channel","p":["A Channel memorises the point where a Router was played, and return to that point when the target label finishes to play.","A Channel statement starts with a <-> (Less Than, Dash and Greater Than), immediately followed by a space.","In the example above, after moving to @Answer, the script flow moves back to line 14, continuing after the Channel. The same occurs on line 20."]}],[{"l":"Travel","p":["Travel is actually a built-in function disguised as a Router statement. It works as other routers, navigating from that point to a given target, but differently from a Router statement, the Travel built-in function allows you to target another script.","The target Script is referenced using its id or Script Reference by Path.","You can also route directly to a label inside the target Script.","Be aware that the Travel built-in function will immediately terminate the current script playing and start the target Script in a new Interpreter instance."]},{"l":"Travel Pass","p":["It's often required to keep the current script and interpreter settings while traveling from one script to another. The $ Travel built-in function will start the new script in a clean instance.","If you need to keep the current settings, use the $ TravelPass instead. It works the same as $ Travel, but it makes a copy of the current Interpreter and keeps Interpreter and Script settings."]}],[{"l":"Command","p":["It's often required to execute programming code during your script play. Command statements can perform two tasks: Handle Quillscript Variables and Call Functions.","Quillscript is completely compatible with Unreal Engine programming, being it Blueprint Visual Scripting or C++, you can call almost any function from your script at any point.","A Command statement starts with a $ (Dollar Sign), immediately followed by a space."]},{"l":"Command as Instruction","p":["A Command can also be concatenated to Dialogue, Option, and other Command statements as an instruction.","Notice that the command marker $ (Dollar Sign) is not required in Command instructions and is implied.","You can concatenate as many Command instructions as required. They execute in the order they are written.","The Command instruction has a different behavior for each statement type.","Dialogue","Execute before the dialogue plays","Option","Execute when the option is selected","Command","Execute after the main command"]}],[{"l":"Quillscript Variables","p":["A variable is a named location in memory that holds a value.","To declare a Quillscript variable, type the desired name, and use the = (Assignment Operator) to assign a value.","Once assigned, you can use this data everywhere in your script and even in your Blueprint/C++ code."]},{"l":"Variable Type","p":["Quillscript is an inferred type language, meaning that the variable type is automatically deduced. There are three variable types: Switch, Number, and Text. The variable type is used to determine the behavior of this variable for each operator, a Number type variable can be used for math operations, for example."]},{"l":"Switch","p":["Represents an on/ off state, also known as Boolean."]},{"l":"Number","p":["For numeric values.

Once created, a global variable can be used in any other script, allowing script intercommunication.","Use global variables when persistence or intercommunication is necessary, and use temporary variables otherwise, since persistent variables take memory space, increase save file size, and increase the duration of certain tasks, like variable replacement in texts and expressions."]},{"l":"Temporary Variables","p":["A Temporary Variable is a Quillscript variable that only exists during that script play. Temporary variables are automatically deleted when the script ends.","These variables are the preferred method for declaring variables when they don't need to exist after a script play.

Therefore, conditions can use the same operators and syntax used by command expressions and be as complex as required."]},{"l":"Condition as Instruction","p":["You can use a condition instruction within any other statement to check if that single statement can be played or should be ignored.","A condition instruction starts with a ? (Question Mark) followed by an expression.","A condition instruction is successful when its expression is evaluated as on and fails in any other case.","In the first dialogue, the interpreter checks if a previously created Quillscript variable has a value bigger or equal to 5.

They are intended for automation and do pre-processing tasks.","A Directive statement starts with a ~ (Tilde), immediately followed by a space and the directive name."]},{"l":"Start","p":["Defines a different starting point for this script.","By default, Quillscript scripts start at the beginning of the text file. With this directive, you can set a custom starting point.","If you have the Keep Script History setting enabled in Quillscript Settings, you can add an index to multiple usages of the Start Directive.

The Interpreter remains in a waiting state and does not proceed to the next line of code until the condition evaluates to true. The condition is an expression that can be evaluated.","It accepts a number parameter to set the delay in seconds between condition checks, this help to improve performance, it check every 0.1 seconds otherwise.","It is also possible to concatenate Command statements to execute before each conditions check."]}],[{"l":"Tag","p":["Tags allow you to decorate your script statements for specific behaviors in custom widgets and Interpreters. They are just additional metadata to be used by your own Blueprints/Classes; they do nothing by default.","A tag instruction starts with a # (Hashtag) followed by its name.","You can place multiple tags in a single instruction or concatenate multiple instructions, both methods result in the same array of tags. A statement can have as many tags as required.","As a usage example, your project may have a Dialog Box widget that shows your character expression when saying a sentence or a Selection Box widget that colorizes an option.","Your custom widgets will receive these tags as an Array of Strings in its Play event 'Tags' parameter."]},{"l":"Key-Value Pair","p":["A tag can be formatted in a key-value pair pattern using : (Colon) like the example below.","On your Interpreter or custom widget, you can check your tags and split the data."]},{"l":"Custom Patterns","p":["Notice that tags are simple strings, meaning you can use custom patterns and formats to pass data, and later, you code your widgets and/or Interpreter to identify these patterns and act accordingly.","For example, you can write a tag using commas or semicolons and split the data later in your custom code."]}],[{"l":"Special Tags","p":["Special tags are tags with built-in behavior.
