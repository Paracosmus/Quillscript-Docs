Even in purely narrated games, the narrator has to say something or expose events and ideas to the player.","A Dialogue statement is composed of two or more lines.","The first line starts with - (dash), immediately followed by a whitespace. The dialog metadata represents information like the speaker’s name and conditions.","The subsequent lines are the dialogue itself, the sentence being said.","As a best practice, we use a . (dot) to express this is a narrator's text.","You can write character interactions putting together as many dialogues as necessary to create a conversation."]}],[{"l":"Repeater","p":["It's common to have a story section where the same character talks successively, causing repetition. You can use this shortcut to avoid repetitive Dialogue header lines. The Repeater is replaced by the last valid Dialogue header line.","A Repeater is defined by a ... (Triple Dots).","A repeater copies the character name, conditions, and tags."]}],[{"l":"Gate","p":["Split a dialogue into two texts, one for true condition, and other for false","By default, when a dialogue condition fails, that dialogue line is ignored. A gate can select a different dialogue text if the condition fails.","A Gate is defined by a --- (Triple Dashes).","Also, with multiline dialogues:"]}],[{"l":"Option","p":["Another essential element for games with story branching is asking the player what they want to do or say in a specific situation. This is expressed in Quillscript as an Options collection.","An Option statement starts with an * (asterisk), immediately followed by a whitespace.","You can sequence as many options as you want; just remember to design your Selection Box widget accordingly."]},{"l":"Multiline Text Option","p":["Options' texts can also come in multiple lines, using a second asterisk, and adding the option text in the following line."]},{"l":"Navigation","p":["As you can see, the above options do nothing after being chosen. You can use an option to move to a desired point of the story by concatenating a Router as instruction."]},{"l":"Execute Commands","p":["Another common use is executing a Command as instruction within an option, like handling a variable or calling a function."]}],[{"l":"Dynamic Options","p":["Dynamic options are used when you don't know the options at design time. They are generated at runtime based on some conditions or data. This is useful when we want to provide a list of options based on some user input or from a data model.","To create dynamic options, you can use add a second * (asterisk). This tells the interpreter that the option is dynamic and will be generated at runtime."]},{"l":"From List","p":["The interpreter will automatically generate the options based on the array or set. Add an * (asterisk) before the array/set variable name and the interpreter will generate a set of options based on that array entries.","You can use as many arrays or sets as you want. The interpreter will generate the options based on the index of each entry and stop on the size of the smallest array."]},{"l":"From Command","p":["This method is used when you need more code control to generate the options. You can use a custom function to generate the options and insert them in the position.","The interpreter will execute the command responsible to generate the options and insert it in the position.","And your options function will inject the options into the Inject Options array from the Quillscript Subsystem.","You can also use this method to direct inject options from code, without the need to call it from script."]}],[{"l":"Label","p":["Labels are markers in specific points of your script flow. They are used as routing points to navigate from one point of the script to another, creating story branches and story flow control.","A Label statement starts with an @ (At Sign), immediately followed by a whitespace.","The label name must be a static name with no variables or text replacements that can alter it during runtime.","As written in the example above, all statements below the declaration of a label belong to that label section until another label is declared."]},{"l":"Label as Instruction","p":["Any statement can be labeled by adding a label as instruction to it. Router statements can use these labels as any other label statement.","It's important to notice that statements can be jumped if they belong to a label statement with a false condition or when they are within a condition statement that is also false. When a router statement points to a label instruction, the flow goes to that point, ignoring any parenting condition and evaluating only the target statement condition, if any."]},{"l":"Display Name","p":["When naming labels, it's common to emerge project patterns that are often non-friendly, containing dots, slashes, prefixes, postfixes, and other marks.","If your project shows labels' names to users for some reason, like in a story tracker, these names are not ideal to be displayed to other developers or players.","You can type a free text line below your label declaration to add a user-friendly name.","Differently from the label declaration itself, which must be a static name, a display name can use variables, replacements, rich text tags, and be formatted or modified by custom code."]}],[{"l":"Covert","p":["A covert label has the same behavior as a standard label, except that a covert label won't play unless explicitly called by a Router. This means if the script flow ever reaches a covert label, it jumps to the following standard label.","A Covert Label starts with <@> (Less Than, At Sign, and Greater Than), immediately followed by a whitespace.","In the example above, the @Where and @Eat labels only play if selected, and the story proceeds to @Continue jumping any covert labels on its flow."]},{"l":"Covert Label as Instruction","p":["If a covert label is used as an instruction in other types of statements, that statement is also jumped unless it is called directly by a router."]}],[{"l":"Template","p":["Templates are a specific type of covert labels that receive entry arguments. A variable is created for each argument and exists until a new label statement is played.","This can reduce repetitive lines and play specific sections of a story that need entry parameters.","Since templates are also covert labels, they can be declared using either @ or <@>","After naming the label, enumerate a list of arguments between parentheses, and separate by commas","Template argument variables start with @","On the router statement, pass the values for each argument in the same order."]},{"l":"Template as Instruction","p":["A label instruction can also be a template. In this case, the statement only plays if directly called by a router, since it becomes a covert statement.","Template variables are created for this statement play and deleted on the following statement play."]}],[{"l":"Router","p":["Routers are navigation controllers to move from one point of the story to a given label, by name. Its main functionality is control where the story should move to, based on player choices, variable values, and custom code.","A Router statement starts with a -> (Dash and Greater Than), immediately followed by a space."]},{"l":"Router as Instruction","p":["A Router can also be concatenated to other statements and used as an instruction.","In Dialogue, Label, Command, and Other Router statements, a router instruction is executed only if the statement conditions fail.","In Option statements, a router instruction is executed when that option is selected."]}],[{"l":"Channel","p":["A Channel memorises the point where a Router was played, and return to that point when the target label finishes to play.","A Channel statement starts with a <-> (Less Than, Dash and Greater Than), immediately followed by a space.","In the example above, after moving to @Answer, the script flow moves back to line 14, continuing after the Channel. The same occurs on line 20."]}],[{"l":"Travel","p":["Travel is actually a built-in function disguised as a Router statement. It works as other routers, navigating from that point to a given target, but differently from a Router statement, the Travel built-in function allows you to target another script.","The target Script is referenced using its id or Script Reference by Path.","You can also route directly to a label inside the target Script.","Be aware that the Travel built-in function will immediately terminate the current script playing and start the target Script in a new Interpreter instance."]},{"l":"Travel Pass","p":["It's often required to keep the current script and interpreter settings while traveling from one script to another. The $ Travel built-in function will start the new script in a clean instance.","If you need to keep the current settings, use the $ TravelPass instead. It works the same as $ Travel, but it makes a copy of the current Interpreter and keeps Interpreter and Script settings."]}],[{"l":"Command","p":["It's often required to execute programming code during your script play. Command statements can perform two tasks: Handle Quillscript Variables and Call Functions.","Quillscript is completely compatible with Unreal Engine programming, being it Blueprint Visual Scripting or C++, you can call almost any function from your script at any point.","A Command statement starts with a $ (Dollar Sign), immediately followed by a space."]},{"l":"Command as Instruction","p":["A Command can also be concatenated to Dialogue, Option, and other Command statements as an instruction.","Notice that the command marker $ (Dollar Sign) is not required in Command instructions and is implied.","You can concatenate as many Command instructions as required. They execute in the order they are written.","The Command instruction has a different behavior for each statement type.","Execute before the dialogue plays","Execute when the option is selected","Execute after the main command"]}],[{"l":"Quillscript Variables","p":["A variable is a named location in memory that holds a value.","To declare a Quillscript variable, type the desired name, and use the = (Assignment Operator) to assign a value.","Once assigned, you can use this data everywhere in your script and even in your Blueprint/C++ code."]},{"l":"Variable Type","p":["Quillscript is an inferred type language, meaning that the variable type is automatically deduced. There are three variable types: Switch, Number, and Text. The variable type is used to determine the behavior of this variable for each operator, a Number type variable can be used for math operations, for example."]},{"l":"Switch","p":["Represents an on/ off state, also known as Boolean."]},{"l":"Number","p":["For numeric values. Integers and floating points."]},{"l":"Text","p":["For string values."]},{"l":"Variable Access","p":["The variable mark describes how Quillscript interpreter handles its lifecycle and other automatized tasks."]},{"l":"Global","p":["By default, any Quillscript variable is global. Once created, a global variable can be used in any other script, allowing script intercommunication.","Use global variables when persistence or intercommunication is necessary, and use temporary variables otherwise, since persistent variables take memory space, increase save file size, and increase the duration of certain tasks, like variable replacement in texts and expressions."]},{"l":"Temporary Variables","p":["A Temporary Variable is a Quillscript variable that only exists during that script play. Temporary variables are automatically deleted when the script ends.","These variables are the preferred method for declaring variables when they don't need to exist after a script play. The use of these variables saves computing resources, since Quillscript has a smaller list of variables to search and apply tasks.","To declare a Temporary Variable, you name it starting with : (colons)."]},{"l":"Outer Variables","p":["Quillscript creates these variables to capture the return value of called functions. They have the same lifecycle of temporary variables and are deleted when the script ends. Check Function Call section for more details."]},{"l":"Template Variables","p":["These variables are created by Quillscript to be used as arguments by a template call. They are deleted when a label statement is reached. Check Template section for more details."]},{"l":"Assigning Variables","p":["Besides assigning static hard-coded values, variables also accept math expressions and other value concatenation methods."]},{"l":"Expressions","p":["You can assign a complete math expression to a single variable, from a simple addition to a complex equation.","It's possible to use other variable values in expressions. Notice the use of (brackets) to use a variable value instead of the literal string \"value\".","You can self-reference the assigned variable in an expression using a {&}.","Or use a reduced assignment operation."]},{"l":"Valid Operators","p":["-","!=","!==","*","/","%","^","+","<","<=","==","===",">",">=","A Text values is converted to numeric if possible, and to 0, otherwise.","Addition","and","Check if a and b are on","Check if a equals b(case insensitive)","Check if a equals b(case sensitive)","Check if a greater or equal b","Check if a greater than b","Check if a less or equal b","Check if a less than b","Check if a not equals b(case insensitive)","Check if a not equals b(case sensitive)","Check if a or b is on","Divide a by b","Division","Equal","Find the remainder of a divided by b","Greater","Greater Equal","Less","Less Equal","Logical AND","Logical OR","Multiplication","Multiply a for b","NOT Equal","off to 0","On Less, Less Equal, Greater, Greater Equal, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Remainder,and Power operations, it's required that the operands are numeric values.
