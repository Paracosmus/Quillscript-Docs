## Quillscript Language

Using a simple set of story writing rules, which includes essential functionalities, like variables, conditions, choices, branching, and code execution; game developers, have a powerful yet straightforward markup language to work with, made with game writers in mind.

A scripting-based dialogue has many advantages over common dialogue systems like spreadsheets, graphs, and data assets. Scripts are plain-text files, meaning they are sequential structures, faster to write and iterate, and simpler to review, edit, follow, and track, just as source-control friendly.
